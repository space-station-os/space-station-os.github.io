# Testing Standards:

I. Unit Testing: Test individual classes and methods in isolation.Usemock objects to simulate dependencies

II. Integration Testing: Focus on interactions between objects and their interfaces

III. System Testing: Validate that contributions adhere to end-to-end requirements

IV. Design Principles in Testing: Test derived classes through their base class interfaces. Write test cases for edge cases (e.g., inheritance ambiguities)

V. Automated Testing:

i. Python: Use pytestfor unit and integration tests

ii. C++: Employ Google Test Framework

iii. Test Coverage: Maintain >85% (?) test coverage for critical modules

iv. Hardware Simulation: Validate numerical consistency with physical principles
