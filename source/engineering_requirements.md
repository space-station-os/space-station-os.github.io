# Engineering requirements (Features, Use Cases)  

## Feature Requests:  

•  Motivate reason (need, interest) with Use Case  

•  Document assumptions and dependencies  

•  Identify cross-package interactions and interfaces  

•  Define requirements in user stories and maintain traceability  

•  Define clear functional and non-functional requirements, linking them to system-level objectives  

•  New features should link to corresponding GitHub issues

•  Use (justify) verification and validation metrics for features

## Object-Oriented Design:

•  Classify modules as classes or objects (e.g., sensors, actuators, controllers).

•  Define interactions using design-by-contract principles (preconditions, postconditions, invariants).

•  Inclusion: Open to all contributors regardless of experience level

•  Support mentorship programs for new developers
