Space Station OS (SSOS) is an open-source development platform for space stations, built on ROS 2 to support interoperability, modularity, and scalability across various space station projects. By unifying core functions like thermal control, power, and life support into reusable modules, Space Station OS provides a universal environment that allows engineers globally to develop and operate space stations collaboratively. This enables rapid innovation and cross-mission compatibility, lowering development costs and enhancing sustainable space station operations.

Space Station OS represents a global effort to democratize space station technology, welcoming contributions from the international aerospace and robotics communities.
