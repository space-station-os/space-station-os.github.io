We are pleased to announce that our news system for the Space Station OS (SSOS) project is now powered by Astro.

This is the first post created using Markdown and rendered into a static site via Astro. In the future, this will allow us to automate project updates, technical announcements, and milestone summariesâ€”directly from development activity.

Stay tuned for more updates as we expand this system to include short-term goals, meeting notes, and contributor highlights.
