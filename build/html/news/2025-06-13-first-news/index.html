<p>This is the first post created using Markdown and rendered into a static site via Astro. In the future, this will allow us to automate project updates, technical announcements, and milestone summariesâ€”directly from development activity.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more updates as we expand this system to include short-term goals, meeting notes, and contributor highlights.</p> </body></html>
