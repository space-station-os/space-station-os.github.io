## Introduction
**Space Station OS** (SSOS) is an open-source ROS 2 platform for unifying the development, simulation, and real-time control of critical space station subsystems—such as guidance and control, power, thermal management, communication, and life support. Treating the space station as both a giant robot and a smart habitat, SSOS applies simulation-first development and modular ROS 2 architecture to enable integrated, fault-tolerant system behavior. By facilitating subsystem coordination, cross-domain interactions, and operational autonomy, SSOS supports advanced research into space habitat operation. Its tools include built-in Fault Detection, Isolation, and Recovery (FDIR) mechanisms and interfaces for both simulation and flight software, making it a foundation for scalable and reliable space infrastructure.
