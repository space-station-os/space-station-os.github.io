## Introduction

**Space Station OS** is an open-source platform designed to advance space station software, facilitating operational research, simulation, and real-time control for space habitats. The system leverages **ROS 2** to provide tools such as Fault Detection, Isolation, and Recovery (FDIR), enhancing the safety and autonomy of space environments.

---

## Key Highlights
- **FDIR Tools** – Advanced fault detection and recovery for mission-critical operations.
- **Real-time Simulations** – Test and validate operations in realistic space scenarios.
- **ROS 2 Integration** – Seamless integration with ROS 2 systems for modular design.
- **Community Driven** – Built with extensibility to allow community contributions.
